    "answer": "B",
    "feedback": "Unlike modern poems, silent reading was not the norm in Sappho’s time. Her poetry was composed to be performed aloud and often set to music using a lyre. These were lyrical compositions meant for group recitation or musical accompaniment, not private reading."

    "feedback": "Sappho deeply influenced poets like Catullus and Horace in Rome and later lyric traditions in Europe. Her's work was rediscovered during the Renaissance, influencing poets like Petrarch and Shakespeare.

    "photoB": "/static/images/5B.png",
    "answer": "B",
    "feedback": "In her own time, Sappho was admired for her poetic skill. The interpretation of Sappho as a queer icon emerged in the 19th century, when scholars and artists began to explore her poetry's themes of love between women in the context of same-sex desire. While her poems express deep affection for women, ancient audiences may not have understood or labeled this in the way modern queer identity is defined today."
