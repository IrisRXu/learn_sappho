                    In this brief fragment, Sappho offers a profound reflection on mortality. 
                    By noting that the gods themselves avoid death, she highlights death's status 
                    as an undesirable fate. This perspective underscores the common Greek view 
                    of the afterlife as a shadowy, diminished existence.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The fragment also suggests Sappho's skepticism toward conventional religious thinking. 
                    While acknowledging the gods' immortality, she subtly questions why, if death were truly 
                    a path to something better, the gods would keep immortality for themselves.
