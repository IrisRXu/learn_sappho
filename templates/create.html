        <h1>Your turn to compose with Sappho’s fragments</h1>
        <p>Sappho’s words have come to us like sea-glass—shaped by time, worn but glowing. Now, it’s your turn to gather them into your feelings and your voice. </p>
        <p><b>Choose</b> Sappho's quotes from the right.</p>
        <p><b>Drag</b> them onto the canvas to begin building your own poem. Arrange them, repeat them, leave gaps. Let silence be part of your voice.</p>
        <!-- <p>Add your own words if you like. You are not just assembling—you’re responding. You’re writing with Sappho.</p> -->
        <p><b>There’s no right way.</b> Your poem can be a whisper or a storm. A single line, or a cascade.</p>
        <!-- <p>When you’re ready, click “Compose” to see your poem.</p> -->
