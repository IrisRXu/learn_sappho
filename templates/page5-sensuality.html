                    He seems to me equal to the gods that man<br>
                    whoever he is who opposite you<br>
                    sits and listens close<br>
                    to your sweet speaking<br><br>
                    
                    and lovely laughing—oh it<br>
                    puts the heart in my chest on wings<br>
                    for when I look at you, even a moment, no speaking<br>
                    is left in me<br><br>
                    
                    no: tongue breaks and thin<br>
                    fire is racing under skin<br>
                    and in eyes no sight and drumming<br>
                    fills ears<br><br>
                    
                    and cold sweat holds me and shaking<br>
                    grips me all, greener than grass<br>
                    I am and dead—or almost<br>
                    I seem to me.

                    This is one of Sappho's most famous poems, describing the physical symptoms of desire. 
                    The narrator experiences a range of physical sensations as they observe their beloved 
                    with someone else.
