Claudia's Checklist
needs work:
- Landing page (the page you first arrive on to guide you to the learning or the quiz portion (quiz is disabled before you finish learning))
- Next/Prev buttons to proceed through learning and quizzing
- Progress bars in the quiz (and/or learning) to indicate your status

done: 
- A header with intuitive icons or words to navigate your page (home, learn, quiz, etc)
- Intuitive instructions and self-explanatory icons (if you have an icon without textual explanation, I should immediately know that I have to click it and what will happen if I click it)
- A backend database/browser session to store your quiz progress
- Immediate feedback in the quiz after submitting the question whether youâ€™re right or wrong (along with explanations if incorrect)
- A final score after your quiz and a screen to show it
- Overall, ensure that everything makes sense to a first time user and that formatting/structure is consistent amongst pages for learning and quizzing.
